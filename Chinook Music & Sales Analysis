# This project uses a version of the Chinook database found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alaasedeeq/chinook/code


# For this project, I used SQL to query the Chinook database to perform various analytics related to musicians and their music, as well as album/song sales with relevant employee metrics.
