# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


-- Table sample:
SELECT *
FROM Spotifydata;

-- 1. What is the average danceability by artist?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

-- 2. Who are the top 10 artists by popularity?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, AVG(popularity)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY MAX(duration_ms) desc;

-- 4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN (SELECT
track_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10);

-- 5. What is the loudness of the 10 highest energy songs?
SELECT track_name, loudness
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10;

-- 6. Which songs are both highly acoustic and high energy?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE acousticness >= 0.4
AND energy >= 0.6

-- 7. Categorize songs by tempo:
SELECT track_name, tempo,
CASE WHEN tempo >= 140 THEN 'Fast-paced Song'
WHEN tempo >= 100 THEN 'Medium-paced Song'
ELSE 'Slow-paced Song'
END AS song_speed
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo desc;

-- 8. Which artists have more than one track in the top 50?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS number_of_tracks
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING number_of_tracks > 1;

-- 9. What is the popularity and speechiness of songs with features?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, speechiness
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%feat.%';
